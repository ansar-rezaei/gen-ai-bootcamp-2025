             Great, A2 level—it is! Let's jump into your intriguing sentence: "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?"

            Sentence 1: "Bears are at the door."
            Clues to build the sentence:
            "Bears" → Think of the plural form of "bear" in German. (Hint: It has an umlaut!)
            "are" → This verb corresponds to "sein" (to be). How do you conjugate it for plural nouns?
            "at the door" → In German, "at" (when referring to a door) uses "an" + the correct case for "door" (Hint: "door" is die Tür, and "an" triggers dative case).
            Now, try forming the sentence!

            Sentence 2: "Did you leave the garbage out?"
            Clues to build the sentence:
            "Did" → In German, questions with past actions do not use "did." Instead, you structure it with the helping verb "haben" and the past participle of "leave."
            "you" → Use du for informal or Sie for formal.
            "leave" (as in "to put something outside") → Think of a verb that means "to put outside" (Hint: rausbringen or hinausstellen).
            "the garbage" → The German word for "garbage" is der Müll.
            "out" → The German word raus (or hinaus) works here.
            Now, try constructing the question! 😊


            First up, here's some vocabulary that'll be useful:

            | English      | German (Dictionary Form) |
            |--------------|--------------------------|
            | Bear         | der Bär              |
            | Door         | die Tür              |
            | To be        | sein                 |
            | To leave     | lassen               |
            | Garbage      | der Müll             |
            | Outside      | draußen              |

            Possible sentence structure:

            1. [Subject] [conjugated verb] [location].
            - e.g., Bears are at the door.

            2. [Conjugated auxiliary verb] [subject] [past participle] [object][adverb]?
            - e.g., Did you leave the garbage out?

            Now, using these clues and structures, try crafting the sentences in German!

            Super! Da du auf B1-Niveau bist, werde ich dir helfen, die Sätze ins Deutsche zu übersetzen, aber du musst ein bisschen mitdenken. 😉 Ich gebe dir Hinweise, aber nicht die ganze Antwort.  

            ---

            ### Satz 1:  
            🧸 "Bears are at the door."  

            #### Hinweise:  
            1. "Bears" → Das ist ein Pluralwort. Wie sagt man „Bär“ auf Deutsch?  
            2. "Are" → Im Deutschen verwenden wir das Verb „sein“. Was ist die richtige Form für Plural?  
            3. "At the door" → Denk an „an der Tür“ oder „vor der Tür“.  

            🔍 Baue den Satz mit diesen Bausteinen zusammen!  

            ---

            ### Satz 2:  
            🗑️ "Did you leave the garbage out?"  

            #### Hinweise:  
            1. "Did you" → Das ist eine Frage in der Vergangenheit. Im Deutschen brauchen wir das Präteritum oder Perfekt (Hilfsverb + Partizip).  
            2. "Leave out" → Dafür gibt es das Verb „rausstellen“ (to put outside).  
            3. "Garbage" → In Deutschland sagt man oft „Müll“ oder „Abfall“.  
            4. "Out" → In diesem Kontext wäre „draußen“ oder „raus“ passend.  

            🔍 Versuche, den Satz zu bilden! Ich helfe dir weiter, wenn du willst. 😉

            ### Vokabeln für beide Sätze:

            | door           | die Tür                     | door       |
            | at             | an / vor                    | at/in front of |
            | to be          | sein                        | to be      |
            | garbage        | der Müll / der Abfall       | garbage, waste |
            | to leave out   | rausstellen                 | to put outside |
            | outside        | draußen / raus              | outside |

            ---

            Satzstruktur für die zweite Frage:  
            - Hast du den Müll rausgestellt? (Perfekt)  
            - Hast du → Hilfsverb („haben“) + Subjekt  
            - den Müll → Akkusativobjekt  
            - rausgestellt → Partizip Perfekt von „rausstellen“
