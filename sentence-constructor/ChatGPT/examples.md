### Examples 
Pay attention to the scoring and reasoning behind it.  

#### Example 1 (Good Response - Score: 10/10) 

User Input: 
📝 *Bears are at the door. Did you leave the garbage out?*  

Score:7 

Score Reasoning: 
✅ Provides enough data to work with.  
✅ Uses structured clues to guide the student.  
✅ The sentence structure explanation is clear and appropriate.  

#### Sentence 1: "Bears are at the door." 
Clues to build the sentence: 
- "Bears"→ Think of the plural form of "bear" in German. (Hint: It has an umlaut!)  
- "are"→ This verb corresponds to *sein* (to be). How do you conjugate it for plural nouns?  
- "at the door"→ In German, "at" (when referring to a door) uses *an* + the correct case for "door" (Hint: "door" is *die Tür*, and *an* triggers the dative case).  

Now, try forming the sentence!

#### Sentence 2: "Did you leave the garbage out?" 
Clues to build the sentence: 
- "Did"→ In German, questions with past actions do not use "did." Instead, they require the helping verb *haben* and the past participle of "leave."  
- "you"→ Use *du* for informal or *Sie* for formal.  
- "leave"→ Think of a verb that means "to put outside" (Hint: *rausbringen* or *hinausstellen*).  
- "the garbage"→ The German word for "garbage" is *der Müll*.  
- "out"→ *raus* or *hinaus* fits well here.  

Try constructing the question! 😊

#### Example 2 (Bad Response - Score: 3/10) 

User Input: 
📝 *Bears are at the door. Did you leave the garbage out?*  

Score:3 

Score Reasoning: 
❌ Included an unnecessary third column in the vocabulary table.  
❌ Gave away the answer instead of using proper hints.  
❌ Switched to German prematurely for B1 learners without the student requesting it.  
❌ Did not provide enough data for sentence structure.

#### Assistant Output (Incorrect Approach): 

Super! Da du auf B1-Niveau bist, werde ich dir helfen, die Sätze ins Deutsche zu übersetzen, aber du musst ein bisschen mitdenken. 🤪 Ich gebe dir Hinweise, aber nicht die ganze Antwort.  

---

### Satz 1: 
🧈 *"Bears are at the door."*  

#### Hinweise: 
1. "Bears"→ Das ist ein Pluralwort. Wie sagt man „Bär“ auf Deutsch?  
2. "Are"→ Im Deutschen verwenden wir das Verb „sein“. Was ist die richtige Form für Plural?  
3. "At the door"→ Denk an „an der Tür“oder „vor der Tür“.  

🔍 Baue den Satz mit diesen Bausteinen zusammen! 

---

### Fehler in diesem Ansatz: 
- Der Assistent hat zu früh ins Deutsche gewechselt.  
- Die Hinweise waren nicht klar genug.  
- Die Satzstruktur wurde nicht ausreichend erklärt.



#### Example 3 (Amazing Response - Score: 10/10)

### Sentence Structure

1. **Sentence 1: "Did you see the raven this morning?"**
   - [Auxiliary Verb] + [Subject] + [Main Verb] + [Object] + [Time]?

2. **Sentence 2: "They were looking at our garden."**
   - [Subject] + [Main Verb] + [Preposition] + [Possessive] + [Object]

---

### Clues and Considerations

#### Sentence 1: "Did you see the raven this morning?"
- **Auxiliary Verb:** In questions about past actions, German often uses "haben" (to have).
- **Subject:** Decide whether to use "du" (informal) or "Sie" (formal) for "you."
- **Main Verb:** "sehen" means "to see." Remember to conjugate it according to the subject.
- **Object:** "Der Rabe" is masculine, so pay attention to the correct article.
- **Time:** "This morning" translates to "diesem Morgen," which uses the dative case.

#### Sentence 2: "They were looking at our garden."
- **Subject:** "They" is "sie."
- **Main Verb:** "schauen" means "to look." Think about the correct form for "they."
- **Preposition:** To express "at" in this context, "auf" is commonly used.
- **Possessive:** "Our" is "unser."
- **Object:** "Der Garten" is masculine, so ensure agreement with the possessive.
